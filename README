ethspray [-v] rx|tx DEV:MAC [DEV:MAC]*
 -v              be verbose (also keeps process in foreground)
 -r --rate       packets per second [10]
 -l --loss N     packet loss trigger level [3]
 -R --rtime N    recoverytime in seconds after reconnect until recovered [200]
 -F              stay in foreground (no daemon)
 -e --exec PRG   run this program to handle events

Ethspray has two modes: 'rx' and 'tx'

rx mode is the receiver mode.
The receiver will expect packets from the MAC-addresses listed.
If sequential packet loss is detected the alarm function will trigger.

tx mode is the transmitter mode.
The transmitter will send packets to all MAC-addresses listed at the given rate.

Exec program:
The program/script given to the '-e' switch receives event information in argv.
 $1 = MAC
 $2 = RESET|FAIL|RECONNECT|RECOVER|LOSS
      RESET is sent at program startup.
 $3 = HH:MM:SS.ms
 $4 = (LOSS PERCENTAGE)
